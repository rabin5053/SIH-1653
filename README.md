## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea

1. AI-Powered Scenario-Based Assessments
Simulated real-world military operations, crisis management, and tactical decision-making.
AI evaluates responses based on strategy, leadership, and adaptability.
2. Real-Time Selector-Applicant Interaction
Live interviews or AI-driven Q&A sessions.
Adaptive difficulty based on applicant performance.
3. Customizable Mission Simulations
Different modules for combat strategy, logistics, intelligence, and diplomacy.
Applicants undergo role-specific assessments (e.g., pilot, commander, analyst).
4. Advanced Data Analytics & Reporting
Performance tracking on decision-making speed, accuracy, and stress management.
Predictive analysis to identify top candidates for specialized roles.
5. Secure & Scalable Cloud Infrastructure
Ensures classified data protection with encryption and role-based access.
Scalable architecture for handling large applicant pools.
## Proposed Solution / Architecture Diagram
The system will be a secure, cloud-based platform that enables selectors (recruiters, military officials) to assess applicants (candidates, officers, soldiers) using AI-driven simulations, real-time assessments, and data analytics.

🛠️ Key Components:
User Interface (UI): Web-based dashboard for selectors and applicants.
AI-Based Assessment Engine: Evaluates performance, decision-making, and response times.
Simulation Module: Interactive military scenario-based assessments (combat, strategy, logistics).
Real-Time Communication: Video, chat, and voice interaction between selectors and applicants.
Data Analytics & Reporting: Insights on individual and group performance.
Security Layer: Encryption, access control, and classified data protection.
Cloud-Based Infrastructure: Scalable architecture for multiple users across locations.
