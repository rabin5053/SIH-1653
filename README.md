## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Use Cases
Alumni Registration and Onboarding Use Case: Alumni sign up and create profiles on the platform.
Actors: Alumni, System

Description: The system allows alumni to register using their email or social media accounts and fill in their personal and professional details. The system verifies their information and creates a profile.

Alumni Networking Use Case: Alumni connect with each other based on interests, professions, or geographic location.
Actors: Alumni, System

Description: The platform provides features like search, filters, and suggestions to help alumni find and connect with each other. They can send connection requests and start conversations.

Event Management Use Case: Organizing and participating in events and reunions.
Actors: Alumni, Event Organizers, System

Description: The platform allows event organizers to create, manage, and promote events. Alumni can view the event calendar, register for events, and receive notifications. Post-event, they can share feedback and view event photos and videos.

Job Portal Use Case: Job searching and posting.
Actors: Alumni, Employers, System

Description: Alumni can search and apply for job opportunities posted by other alumni or affiliated employers. Employers can post job openings and review applications through the platform.

Mentorship Programs Use Case: Connecting alumni mentors with mentees. Actors: Alumni (Mentors and Mentees), System
Description: The platform matches mentees (students or recent graduates) with mentors (experienced alumni) based on their profiles and areas of interest. They can then schedule meetings, track progress, and provide feedback.
